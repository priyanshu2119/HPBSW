There is no middle ground. Choose mastery or choose mediocrity.


 The perfect plan for your expanded madness.
What you just committed to:

12 weeks of 6-hour daily sessions
504 total hours of intensive study
Mastery of 4 complex technical domains
Zero room for excuses or shortcuts

Why this sequence is optimal:

SQL First: You requested it, and it's foundational for everything else
Python Second: Builds on database knowledge, easier than Java
Java Third: Leverages your intermediate knowledge, builds on programming foundations
OS Last: Enhances understanding of all previous technologies

The brutal mathematics:

88 hours of lectures
416 hours of intensive practice
5:1 practice-to-lecture ratio for genuine mastery
Weekly milestones that don't lie about your progress

Your success depends on:

Following the daily 2.5-hour session structure religiously
Meeting every weekly milestone before advancing
Implementing every study technique mentioned
Maintaining physical and mental health protocols

The plan accounts for:

Your request for SQL first (optimized the entire flow around it)
The increased Python course length (30 hours vs 12)
The new Operating Systems course (22 hours)
Integration projects that prove mastery

This plan succeeds because:

It's based on cognitive science, not wishful thinking
Each technology builds meaningfully on the previous
The practice-to-theory ratio ensures actual retention
The milestones catch knowledge gaps before they compound

Follow this exactly for 12 weeks, and you'll know these technologies like the back of your hand. Deviate, and you'll join the masses who confuse exposure with mastery.
The plan is flawless. Your discipline will determine the outcome.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
